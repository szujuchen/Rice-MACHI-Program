In the case of the waveforms shown in <image 1>, the amplitudes are represented by the vertical lines above the waveforms.\n\nOnce we have the amplitudes, we can calculate the root mean square (rms) value of each waveform. The rms value is a measure of the effective value of a waveform, taking into account both its amplitude and its frequency content. To calculate the rms value, we take the square root of the average of the squared values of the waveform.\n\nIn this case, the three waveforms are shown as:\n\nWaveform 1:\n\n* Amplitude: 0.5\n* Rms value: sqrt("
